Presentation Hero is a Unity project designed to simulate a public speaking event in a conference room. 
It is designed to work with the Oculus Rift, but can be used without it.  

Once the demo is running, pressing Q or E will switch between Oculus Rift and Normal mode.

I decided to make this open source since there is definite potential here, but my skills are limited.
If someone with 3D modeling skills would jump on this and animate the audience... that would be great.

The FPS model I am using is a wizard I found on the interwebz.  Feel free to replace him with something better.

Make this into something wonderful!
